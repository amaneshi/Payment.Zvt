## Tested Providers and Terminals

Provider | Terminal | 
--- | --- |
CardComplete | ingenico iWL250 |
Hobex | ingenico Desk/3500 |
Wordline (SIX) | yomani touch family |

### Known deviations from the standard ZVT protocol

#### CardComplete
- Encoding is fixed to `UTF-8` instead of default character set `CP437`. There is no way to configure this
- `Print Line` contains TLV data at the end of the package, after `TLV-activation`. According to official documentation, there should be no TLV data here

#### Hobex
- No `Print Line` support
- Sends TLV data even without `TLV-activation`
